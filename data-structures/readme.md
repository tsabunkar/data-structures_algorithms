# DataStructures

- Structuring your data into particular format is called - Data Structures
- What do data-structure do ? -> Data structures are collections of values, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
- Why are they so many ? Different data structure excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like - arrays, object) are more generally used.
  Thus- highly specialized dat structures like graph, hashTable, Tree - These we won't get any programming language for free/out-of-box. Where as Commonly used data structure like arrays, object are avaliable in most of the programming lang in built.
- Why should we care ? -> The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures. Also as developer we can't just use arrays/object to solve all the problems (need to explaned our tool set[ knowledge ] to tackle different problems).
- There is no 'BEST' Data structures - They all excel in different situations.
- ex :
- Working with map/location data ? ==> You want to use graph data structure
- Need an ordered list with fast inser/removals at the begining and end ? ==> Linked list will help !
- Web scraping neseted HTML ? ==> Use Tree
- Need to write a scheduler ? ==> Think about binary heap

# Classes

- What is class ? - A blueprint for creating an objects with pre-defined properties and methods.
- JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript.
- Why to learn this ? We're going to implement data-structures as classes
- The method to create a new objects must be called -> constructor
- use new keyword to create instances of Object
- Static Methods : The static keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods aren't called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself. These are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects.
