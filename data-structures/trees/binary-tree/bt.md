# Binary Tree

- Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.
- A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
