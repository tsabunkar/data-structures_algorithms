# Dijkstra's Shortestpath Algorithm

- This alogrithm helps to find the shortest path between two node/vertices on a graph ( Whats the fastest way to get from point A to point B)
- It uses : Graph, Binary heap Priority Queue
- Famous and widely used Algorithms used in real world
- Dijkstra was ->
  - Edsger Dijkstra was a dutch programmer, physicist, essayist and all around smarty-pants
  - He helped to advance the field of computer science from an 'art' to an academic discipline
  - Many of his discoveries and algorithms are still commonly used today
- Uses :
  - GPS- finding fastest route
  - Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
  - Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among the human
  - Airline tickets - Finding cheapest route to your destination
